__Introduction__

The field of Quantitative Genetics (QG) is concerned with the evolution of
continuous characters, that is, characters that vary in an infinitesimal scale.
QG have provided models to predict the response to selection of continuous
charaters by means of its heritability and the intensity of selection (i.e. the
selection differential), the so called Breeder's Equation, in reference to the
artificial selection exerted by breeders in animals and plants (Falconer and
Mackay, 1996). This achievment is the result of the joined work of several great
names of evolutionary biology, such as Karl Pearson, J.B.S. Haldane, Ronald 
Fisher and Sewall Wright, back in the 1920-30 decades, the period of development
of the Modern Synthesis. QG continued to develop and expanded its models to 
predict the response to selection of several characters simultaneously 
considering the multivariate inheritance of the characters (Lande 1979,
 Lande and Arnold,1983). This expansion of the selection theory to the 
 multivariate space has been incorporated in studies of the evolution
 of complex characters  and the related concepts of integration, modularity and
 evolvability.
 	In this review, we explain all of these multivariate related concepts while
 using a fictitious database to exemplify the evolutionary questions that can be 
 addressed as well as the mathematical underpinnings of doing so. In order to
 facilitate the visualization of the calculations and its graphical representations,
 the database is constituted of only 4 dimensions: ulmer, radius, phemur and 
 tibial lengths, in five species of rodents that have also a fictitious phylogeny.
